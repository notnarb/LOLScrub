# Description
Services to run on a front-end node.  Includes an nginx instance to act as a reverse proxy, a container to build the html/css/javascript files, and an app server for the static javascript files to interact with

# How to run
## Setup
Note: web server requres a server.crt and server.key generated externally.
## Dependencies
'docker-compose up' should manage everything.  This will start nginx and listen externally to port 80 and 443, mount the files generated by the static file generator, and forward requests to the app server.
